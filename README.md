# VMware GemFire feature examples
The examples in this project are showcase features of GemFire and demonstrate their basic usage.

For details on all GemFire featues, see [VMware GemFire Documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-GemFire).

## VMware GemFire Version
Your client code must link against the _same or older_ version (ignoring patch versions) of VMware GemFire as the VMware GemFire server it will connect to.

To link against an older version of GemFire, edit the `gemfireVersion=` line in `gradle.properties`.

## Running an example
In order to execute the examples in this project, follow these steps:
1. Ensure [JDK 11](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/) is installed (and set JAVA_HOME if it's not the default).  You _can__ also use JDK8, but some individual examples will fail.  JDK17 is not yet supported.
1. Download the version of GemFire that you want to use as the server from [Tanzu Network](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/pivotal-gemfire/)
1. Unpack the GemFire TAR file and set your `GEMFIRE_HOME` to point at it. `GEMFIRE_HOME` will be the top level directory inside the extracted GemFire.  For example, if you extracted in /tmp/downloads, export GEMFIRE_HOME=/tmp/downloads/vmware-gemfire-10.0.0
1. Sign up for the [GemFire Maven repo](https://commercial-repo.pivotal.io/) and follow the instructions there to set up gemfire-examples to use your authentication credentials.  Note: be sure to click on the Gradle tab for gradle-specific instruction; the steps shown by default are for mvn projects only.
1. You can now run an example with the following gradle targets:

* `build` - compiles the example and runs unit tests
* `start` - initializes the VMware GemFire cluster
* `run` - runs the example Application
* `stop` - shuts down the cluster
* `runAll` - invokes start, run, stop

The commands you need to run a specific example will be given in the `README.md` file. Sample
usage:

    $ ./gradlew :replicated:start
    $ ./gradlew :replicated:run
    $ ./gradlew :replicated:stop
