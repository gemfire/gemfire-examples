# GemFire Compression example

This is a simple example that demonstrates enabling Compression in a
replicated region. The Default compression algorithm included with GemFire is Snappy. Additionally, you can specify your own compressor algorithm as well by implementing `org.apache.geode.compression.Compression` Interface. For enabling compression on a GemFire region you can follow the official [document](https://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/113/managing/region_compression.html#topic_inm_whc_gl).

This example assumes you have installed JDK11 and GemFire.

## Steps

1. From the `gemfire-examples/compression` directory, build the example and
   run unit tests

        $ ../gradlew build

2. Next start the locator, two servers and create replicated region `example-region` with `compression` enabled.

        $ gfsh run --file=scripts/start.gfsh

3. Run the example to create and get entries using GemFire Java Client from the region

        $ ../gradlew run
        
4. Shut down the system:

        $ gfsh run --file=scripts/stop.gfsh
